            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">1. Emotional and confidence </b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">The year 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting and transformative period for those born under the zodiac sign of Cancer. Cancer signs tend to be emotionally perceptive and share deep connections with loved ones, yet also require security and stability. As we head into 2025, Cancers will have chances to build greater confidence and comfort in themselves while expanding their horizons</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 300px;">
            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">2. Career and Experienced</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">Career-wise, you’re kicking off the year strong! Mars moves into your 12th house on August 2, hinting at some potential for foreign gains. And with the Sun lighting up your 7th house, business expansion is in the cards though it’s wise to stay cautious in certain sign placements. Lean on the advice of experienced friends and family; your siblings may even lend a hand in your business pursuits.</p>

            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">3. Relationship and Family ties</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">October brings a calming vibe, and November opens doors for more social exchanges, solidifying your bonds. By year’s end, married couples can look forward to deepening closeness. Early 2025 sets a strong harmony in family life, and this continues throughout the year. But keep patience after May 14th when Jupiter and Rahu’s transit on the 18th could stir up some family disagreements. Overall, it’s a peaceful year filled with family love, sibling support, and strong social ties.</p>

            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">4. Finances and support</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">2At the start of 2025, money might feel a bit tight, but don’t stress. Saturn and Venus are teaming up in your 9th house, promising a steady income stream and support from your loved ones. Saturn’s position is all about growth, though with Mars camping out in your 12th house, keep an eye on health, love, and finances.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 300px;">
            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">5. Health and Issues</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">Starting 2025, you may feel some health challenges. The previous Jupiter transit, Saturn in the 8th house, and Rahu in the 9th may have weighed you down with stress, anxiety, or other physical issues. But hang tight, Jupiter’s new transit will gradually lift your mental stress, bringing relief. Cholesterol, sugar levels, and even your family’s health are on track to improve. Minor issues like allergies from dust and pollen may pop up, but Mars brings a boost of energy. Hydrate well and tackle those health concerns early.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 300px;">
            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">6. Major Influences and Timing</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">The year 2025 has some seriously good vibes for you, Cancer, especially in career, finance, and education. Right from the start, Saturn shifts into the 9th house in Pisces on March 29, and then Rahu slides into the 8th house in Aquarius by May 18. Jupiter, hanging out in your 11th house in Taurus as the year kicks off, will take a brief stop in Gemini’s 12th house on May 14, before visiting Cancer’s 1st house and heading back to the 12th by December. This cosmic shuffle brings growth and some rewarding shifts your way.</p>
