            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">1. Career and Ambitions</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">Capricorns are known for their ambition and drive, and 2025 will encourage you to focus even more on long-term professional goals. There may be a significant career shift, either in the form of a promotion, a new job, or a change in direction. The alignment of planets, especially Uranus, will push you out of your comfort zone, asking you to innovate and adapt to new ways of working.<br>

                Saturn's Influence:<br> With Saturn in your sign for much of the year, you'll feel a strong sense of responsibility and pressure to build something lasting. This is a year for hard work and persistence, but the rewards can be substantial if you're patient.
                Jupiter's Influence:<br> Jupiter might bring opportunities for expansion and growth, especially in the first half of the year. It could open doors for networking, travel, or educational pursuits that support your career development.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 300px;">
            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">2.Finances</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">2025 will be a time to be strategic with your finances. You might find that your financial stability requires attention, especially if you've been focusing on big ambitions or investments that take longer to pay off.<br>

                Investment Opportunities:<br> There could be chances to make long-term investments, but it's important to conduct thorough research. Risks are present, but with Saturn's influence, you may find your cautious approach pays off.
                Financial Discipline:<br> You'll need to practice discipline and avoid overspending. Saving and investing wisely can build a solid foundation for the future.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">In relationships, Capricorn may experience both stability and transformation in 2025.<br>

                Deepening Connections:<br> If you're in a committed relationship, this could be a year where you grow closer and take significant steps toward building a future together, such as moving in, getting engaged, or even starting a family.<br>
                New Beginnings:<br> For single Capricorns, 2025 could bring new romantic opportunities. The energy of 2025 might favor more serious relationships rather than casual ones, so if you're ready for commitment, a significant connection might manifest.<br>
                Communication:<br> With Pluto influencing your house of relationships, communication could become deeper and more intense. There may be moments where you need to confront issues from the past to strengthen your current bond.</p>

                Stress Management:<br> With Saturn's influence, there's a tendency to take on too much. Make sure you set aside time for relaxation and exercise, as your mental and physical health should be balanced.<br>
