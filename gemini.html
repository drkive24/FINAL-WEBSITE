            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">1. Personal Growth and Transformation</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">2025 is set to be a transformative year for you, Gemini. With the cosmos aligning in ways that encourage personal and spiritual growth, this year will offer you new opportunities to expand your horizons. As an air sign, you thrive on change and the freedom to explore new ideas and experiences, and this year will offer plenty of both. However, with change comes responsibility, and you'll need to balance your natural curiosity with a focus on stability and groundedness.</p>

            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">2. Career and Ambitions</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">Gemini, if career growth is on your mind, you’re in for a ride. With Rahu kicking off the year in your 10th house, your ambitions are primed to soar, especially from January to May. You’ll feel supported by your peers and seniors, setting up a comfortable and productive work environment. But heads up! April to June could be tricky. Mars’ influence might stir up workplace drama. Slow down, avoid knee-jerk reactions, and make sure you’re working with the facts before jumping into anything major. Your strategy will be your secret weapon.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">In 2025, It’s going to be a blend of sweetness and some sour notes, so stay alert. The year kicks off with strong vibes between you and your spouse, bringing in happiness and the potential for some financial gains through them. But be careful between April and June. Misunderstandings or arguments might cause some problems. Both of you might be caught up in wrong assumptions, making communication key. If you stay calm and clear, you’ll navigate through this rocky phase.</p>

The year might start off a little shaky, with a few financial setbacks, especially between January and March. It’s a time to keep a tight grip on your spending and avoid any impulse buys. But don’t worry, things start picking up from June onwards. With the help of some favorable planetary movements, your financial situation is going to take a positive turn. Unexpected gains, refunds, or even money from abroad are likely to flow your way.</p>

            <b style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 150px;">5. Health and Wellness</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 320px; margin-right: 300px;">The year 2025 brings better health and the end of the ailments that you have been suffering for a long. Recovery could be speedy from ailments that you may suffer this year. No prolonged illness, just minor health issues like viral fever, influenza, tooth ache, gastric issues, etc. may occur from time to time. All you  need is to take proper medication for even minor ailments. Skin related issues might rise for some Gemini Zodiac signs. You might feel a sudden change in mental and physical health due to the malefic effects of Rahu, but soon you will be able to successfully start over a new journey towards getting healthy. You may come across little bone-related issues which would be due to deficiency in your body. Start supplements with the prescription of the Doctor.</p>
